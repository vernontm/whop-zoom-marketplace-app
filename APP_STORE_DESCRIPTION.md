Full Description

Bring Your Zoom Meetings to Whop

Zoom Livestream seamlessly integrates your Zoom meetings into your Whop experience. Host coaching calls, webinars, workshops, or community events and let your members watch live without leaving Whop.

Key Features

One-Click Join
Members see a beautiful, branded page that automatically detects when you go live. They click "Join Meeting" and instantly enter your Zoom call—no Zoom account or download required.

Secure & Protected Streaming
Stop link sharing and piracy in its tracks. Unlike raw Zoom links that can be forwarded to anyone, your meetings are protected behind Whop's authentication. Only verified, paying members can access your content—saving you money and protecting your revenue.

No shareable links — Meetings are embedded, not linked
Member-only access — Whop verifies every viewer
Protect your content — Keep your premium streams exclusive

Real-Time Detection
The app automatically detects when your meeting starts and ends using Zoom webhooks. No manual toggling needed.

Push Notifications
Notify your entire community when you go live. Customize the notification message for meeting start and end events.

Fully Customizable
Set your own page title
Choose your brand color for the viewer page

Admin Dashboard
Easy setup with a clean dashboard to configure your Zoom credentials, preview the client experience, and manage notification settings.
